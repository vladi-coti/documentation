# Features

The COTI Node Ecosystem packages node operation into a small number of high-level features. Each one is surfaced in the web app (see [Networks](./#networks) for the testnet and mainnet URLs) and backed by one or more of the ecosystem services described in [backend-services.md](backend-services.md).

## 1. Guided installation

A step-by-step wizard at **`/setup`** takes an operator from a fresh **certified Ubuntu** environment (Linux server or **Windows 11** + **WSL 2** + **Ubuntu 26.04 LTS** — see [**Server requirements**](server-requirements.md)) to a **running COTI full node** with **public JSON-RPC** (either **HTTPS on your host** with your own domain, or **via the COTI tunnel** with a COTI-assigned hostname).

* Generates (or accepts) a node private key locally — the key never leaves the browser.
* On **Setup FQDN**, offers **Generate FQDN for Me** (success banner and read-only **Node FQDN**) or **Bring your own FQDN** (hostname field, A/CNAME reminder, verification checkbox, and **Back to Generation**); for BYO, validates the hostname via a live DNS lookup before continuing.
* Produces a single-line installer command, tailored to the node's key and hostname, that the operator runs as root on the target server (see [**Installation**](installation.md) — [**Wizard tunnel**](installation-wizard-tunnel.md) or [**Own domain**](installation-own-domain.md)).
* Watches the peer-discovery network and advances automatically once the node is seen by peers.

See [**Installation**](installation.md) for what the installer does on the server, and the [**UI guide**](ui-guide/README.md) for the wizard walkthrough.

## 2. Live ecosystem view

The home page of the web app exposes the current state of the node network:

* **Live node heartbeats** — a running count of nodes currently observed by peer discovery.
* **Reward-eligible nodes (last epoch)** — how many nodes met the rules in the previous epoch.
* **COTI dropped (last epoch)** — total rewards distributed in the previous epoch.
* **Total COTI earned** — cumulative rewards paid to operators to date.
* **Nodes table** — every node the system knows about, with operator name, total rewards, online status, uptime, and latency.

This view is read-only and does not require a wallet connection.

## 3. Per-operator dashboard

Once an operator connects a wallet that owns a COTI Node NFT, **`/my-nodes`** becomes the per-operator dashboard:

* Current node status (active / syncing / offline) and thermal state (warming up / hot / cooling down / cold).
* **Warm-up progress bar** for nodes that have just been installed and are not yet hot.
* All-time totals: uptime, rewards, latency.
* Per-epoch rewards history with USDC/COTI snapshots, uptime, earned amount, and eligibility status.
* Edit node flow (`/edit-node`) for NFT metadata: name, image URI, and optional more-info URL (stored on the Soulbound NFT).

## 4. Eligibility checks

Anyone can read how reward eligibility works before installing a node. For a given epoch, an operator is eligible when **either** of these **paths** is fully satisfied (thresholds come from the **CotiNodeRewards** contract and can change):

* **Path 1 — USDC + COTI.** **All** of: USDC on the COTI network ≥ the combo USDC threshold; **COTI** (non-custodial; **not** on centralized exchanges) ≥ the combo COTI threshold; **uptime** ≥ the configured percentage.
* **Path 2 — COTI only.** **Both** of: **COTI** ≥ the higher **solo** threshold (no USDC required); **uptime** ≥ the same percentage as Path 1.

**Uptime is required on every path.** The **`/eligibility`** page explains this layout in plain language (two cards with an **OR** between them). The home page also exposes **Check My Eligibility**, which opens the same style of check in a modal or routes operators who already have a node NFT to **My Node**.

## 5. Automatic uptime monitoring

Once a node has been continuously seen by peer discovery for long enough to be considered **hot**, the ecosystem:

1. Mints a Soulbound **Node NFT** to the operator's wallet.
2. Registers the node's RPC URL with **Better Stack** as a monitored endpoint.
3. Runs a multi-signal health check against the node's RPC **through its DNS** to confirm the node is actually operating — simply responding is not enough.
4. Aggregates the resulting uptime per epoch and exposes it in the per-operator dashboard.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Rewards require a valid DNS.** The ecosystem only measures uptime by calling the node's RPC through the FQDN the operator supplies during setup. A node without a reachable FQDN cannot be monitored and therefore cannot earn rewards — even if it is fully synced on the network.
{% endhint %}

The operator does not interact with Better Stack directly — monitoring is fully automatic. A **public status page** aggregates every hot node's monitor and is available at the URL listed in [Networks](./#networks).

## 6. Rewards distribution

Rewards are distributed each **epoch** (103 hours). At the end of every epoch, the rewards service:

1. Reads the node's per-epoch uptime from the monitoring platform.
2. Reads the operator's USDC and COTI holdings at the epoch snapshot.
3. Evaluates the eligibility rules (see [Feature 4](features.md#4-eligibility-checks)).
4. Records each eligible node's reward allocation in the on-chain **rewards smart contract**.

Rewards are **not** auto-deposited to the operator's wallet. Once the contract has been credited, the operator claims the accrued balance either from the **Claim Now** button in the **My Node** dashboard or by calling the rewards smart contract directly from any wallet they control. Unclaimed rewards remain available until claimed.

The per-operator dashboard shows each past epoch with uptime, holdings, earned amount, and an "Eligible / Ineligible" badge. See the [Node Ecosystem Litepaper](coti-node-ecosystem-litepaper.md) for the economic model.
