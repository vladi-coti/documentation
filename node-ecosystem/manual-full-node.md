# Manual full node setup (without the wizard)

← [**Installation**](installation.md) (this page is the last subpage under Installation)

This page is the **operator-managed** path: you install and run a COTI full node using the [`coti-full-node`](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-full-node) repository and Docker on your own server — **not** through the Nodes web app wizard, one-liner installer host, or guided spin-up UI.

> **New to running a node?** Use the **wizard** first — [**Installation**](installation.md) and [**UI guide**](ui-guide/README.md). It is the quickest path for most people; return here only if you intentionally skip the web app.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Web app wizard (recommended for most operators):** follow [**Installation**](installation.md), [**Server requirements**](server-requirements.md) (OS and sizing), and the [**UI guide**](ui-guide/README.md). You get the guided flow, installer from the [Networks](./#networks) table, HTTPS, and monitoring hooks from the product.

**This page (manual path):** you clone the repo, configure the host, and run `start` / `stop` scripts yourself. Reward **eligibility is the same** as the wizard path when your node satisfies ecosystem rules (FQDN, JSON-RPC reachability, license / holdings, uptime thresholds, etc.) — see [**Node Ecosystem overview**](./) and [**Installation**](installation.md) for authoritative requirements.
{% endhint %}

### Requirements

COTI full node software is published as a Docker image.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Disclaimer:** Successfully operating, troubleshooting, and maintaining a node requires technical proficiency. Familiarity with tools such as Linux, Docker, and Git is assumed. Users not familiar with this technology stack should consider the [**Installation**](installation.md) / [**UI guide**](ui-guide/README.md) flow or assigning their license to an existing operator.
{% endhint %}

**Certified operating system, tested Docker/Compose versions, and hardware** (CPU, memory, disk by network, example cloud SKUs) are **identical** for the [wizard](installation.md) and this manual path — see [**Server requirements**](server-requirements.md).

***

### Network Configuration

#### Open Ports: Protocol and Purpose

You should open the following ports in your host firewall (e.g., UFW) **and** in your cloud provider’s security groups to permit inbound traffic.\
Be aware that **different ports use different protocols (TCP/UDP)** depending on their purpose.

<table><thead><tr><th width="80">Port</th><th width="104.5">Protocol</th><th width="275">Purpose</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>7400</td><td>TCP</td><td>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication</td><td>Data layer used for establishing a connection, exchanging blocks, and synchronizing blockchain data with other nodes.</td></tr><tr><td>7400</td><td>UDP</td><td>Node Discovery (Discv4/Discv5)</td><td>Discovery layer used to quickly find the addresses of other nodes on the network, including the bootnodes and all other peers.</td></tr><tr><td>8545</td><td>TCP</td><td>HTTP-RPC API</td><td>Used for external applications to query chain data and submit transactions over HTTP.</td></tr><tr><td>8546</td><td>TCP</td><td>WebSocket-RPC API</td><td>Used for real-time communication, allowing external applications to receive live updates and subscribe to blockchain events.<br></td></tr></tbody></table>

* **Static IP**: Required to ensure stable RPC access, enabling continuous health monitoring.

### Setting up Your Node Environment

COTI full nodes are run using docker. Docker provides a way for everyone to run battle-tested, reliable images, known to work with the network.

#### Prerequisites

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="257.44818115234375"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ol><li>Git</li></ol></td><td>See <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git"><strong>git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</strong></a></td></tr><tr><td><ol start="2"><li>Docker</li></ol></td><td>See <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository"><strong>docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu</strong></a></td></tr><tr><td><ol start="3"><li>Docker Compose</li></ol></td><td>See <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/standalone/"><strong>docs.docker.com/compose/install/standalone</strong></a></td></tr></tbody></table>

Target the **Docker Engine** and **Compose** versions listed under [**Server requirements → Software stack**](server-requirements.md#software-stack) so your stack matches what COTI certifies.

### Installation Steps

{% hint style="info" %}
The following recommended steps reflect best practices but should be performed carefully, as they may significantly impact the operating system.
{% endhint %}

1. **Recommended steps:**
   1.  Set host name (where `<name>`is your chosen node name)

       \{% code fullWidth="false" %\}

       ```bash
       sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <name>-full-node
       ```

       \{% endcode %\}
   2.  Update package lists

       \{% code fullWidth="false" %\}

       ```bash
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt upgrade
       ```

       \{% endcode %\}
   3.  Reboot system

       \{% code fullWidth="false" %\}

       ```bash
       sudo reboot
       ```

       \{% endcode %\}
   4.  Update OS

       \{% code fullWidth="false" %\}

       ```bash
       sudo do-release-upgrade
       ```

       \{% endcode %\}
2. **Configure Docker**
   *   Add your user to the `docker` group:

       \{% code fullWidth="false" %\}

       ```bash
       sudo usermod -aG docker $( whoami )
       ```

       \{% endcode %\}
   *   Logout and re-login

       \{% code fullWidth="false" %\}

       ```bash
       logout
       ```

       \{% endcode %\}
3.  **Clone the COTI Full Node project**

    \{% code fullWidth="false" %\}

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/coti-io/coti-full-node.git
    ```

    \{% endcode %\}
4.  **Checkout the stable release tag (Recommended):**

    * NOTE: Replace `v1.1.4-mainnet` with the actual latest stable tag (e.g., `v1.1.4-discovery` for Testnet).

    ```bash
    git checkout tags/<latest_stable_tag>
    # Example for Mainnet: git checkout tags/v1.1.4-mainnet
    ```
5. **Start Your Node**
   1.  Navigate to the newly created "coti-full-node" directory

       \{% code fullWidth="false" %\}

       ```bash
       cd coti-full-node
       ```

       \{% endcode %\}
   2.  Execute node start script

       ```
       ./start_coti-full-node.sh
       ```
   3.  Once the docker-compose has started the node, liveliness check will be executed

       ```
       ./liveness_coti-full-node.sh
       ```

       \
       Output example:

       ```
       Initial block number: 208539
       Check 1: Block number is 208540
       Block number has progressed. Node is syncing.
       ```

{% hint style="info" %}
If liveliness check passed locally it means that your node is syncing with the other nodes in the network.
{% endhint %}

5.  **To Check Node Logs**

    ```
    docker logs -f coti-full-node
    ```

### Restarting Your Node

To restart your node follow these steps:

1.  Stop your node

    \{% code fullWidth="false" %\}

    ```bash
    ./stop_coti-full-node.sh
    ```

    \{% endcode %\}
2.  Start your node

    \{% code fullWidth="false" %\}

    ```bash
    ./start_coti-full-node.sh
    ```

    \{% endcode %\}

### Node Configuration

If you are running a node without a license, no further configuration of the node is required. Simply ensure you are connected to the network.

### Verifying Node Functionality

* Metrics: Visit [**uptime.coti.io**](https://uptime.coti.io) to track performance and status.

{% hint style="info" %}
Metrics monitoring is not available yet for Testnet .
{% endhint %}

* Node availability is crucial for the smooth operation of the network.\
  \
  To evaluate node availability, COTI leverages a monitoring platform that publishes this data. A node is considered available if it successfully responds to the `eth_blockNumber` request. Using this request ensures the node is actively synchronized with the network and functioning correctly.

### Incentives

Validation rewards are governed by the [**Node Ecosystem**](./) program (uptime, FQDN reachability, license and holdings rules, epoch cadence, and other thresholds). Exact requirements can change — use the ecosystem documentation, web app, and the **Node Economy** section of the [litepaper](coti-node-ecosystem-litepaper.md) as the source of truth.

Licensed full nodes have commonly been expected to sustain **high uptime** (for example **≥ 98%** over an epoch of roughly **103 hours**) to remain eligible for validation rewards; confirm the current bar in the Node Ecosystem pages.

Following **this manual guide** instead of the ecosystem installer **does not change** those rules: you can still earn rewards when your deployment meets the **same** eligibility conditions the ecosystem enforces.

### Maintenance & Monitoring

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep your node software updated to the latest version. This ensures you receive security patches and new features.
2. **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU, RAM, and disk space to ensure uninterrupted operation.
3. **Uptime**: Use a process manager (like `systemd`) or Docker auto-restart policies to keep your node running if it crashes unexpectedly.

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

* Peer Connection Errors: Ensure your ports are open and your firewall allows inbound connections.
* High Resource Usage: Upgrade your hardware or adjust configuration settings to reduce overhead.

### FAQ

1. How many nodes can I run?
   1. There’s no set limit, but each node requires its own resources. Running multiple nodes can help decentralize the network but comes with higher operational costs.
2. Can I run a node on a VPS or cloud platform?
   1. Absolutely. Just ensure the service meets the hardware, OS, and networking requirements.
3. Do I earn more rewards by running a more powerful node?
   1. Generally, consistently high uptime can lead to more consistent rewards, however, the only measure to qualify for rewards is uptime.
4. Is it mandatory to purchase a node license to run a node?
   1. No. A node license simply allows you to earn rewards for helping decentralize the network, however, it is not necessary to run a COTI node.

### Next Steps

Congratulations on setting up your COTI node using the **manual** path. Reward eligibility still follows the **Node Ecosystem** rules linked below.

The following related sections may be helpful:

* [coti-node-ecosystem-litepaper.md](coti-node-ecosystem-litepaper.md "mention")
* [**Node Ecosystem overview**](./) — eligibility, thresholds, and the managed experience at [testnet.nodes.coti.io](https://testnet.nodes.coti.io) / [nodes.coti.io](https://nodes.coti.io), including the guided [installer](installation.md), [UI walkthrough](ui-guide/README.md), and [glossary](ui-guide/glossary.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Rewards require a valid FQDN and reachable JSON-RPC.** The Node Ecosystem measures uptime by calling your node’s JSON-RPC through the domain you register. A node that syncs locally but is **not** publicly reachable on a valid FQDN will **not** accrue credited uptime and will **not** be eligible for rewards — whether you installed via this manual guide or via the web app wizard. See [Installation](installation.md).
